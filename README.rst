Yacs Personal Tools
###################

Collection of small utility programs that make yac's life easier and
does not really seem to fit into other/separate projects.

This project will iteratively deprecate `ydu`_ which is mostly written
in shell but also python and go-lang and they all suck. And the name
sucks as well since it doesn't reflect the contents well.
